# ApexAI-Voice-Enabled-Chatbot
A voice assistant using OpenAI and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. A virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI's GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user.

Steps to run ApexAI

Method 1: Run it in a Cloud based IDE like [Cloud Code](https://cloud.google.com/code) or [Skill Network](https://skills.network/lab-tools/cloud-ide#) (used here) for testing and demonstration to avoid API key complications and/or Dockerfile launches

In this approach you can open the IDE and make the folder structure given above OR use the git clone command [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone) and clone this repository

Make sure all your folders are placed in proper hierarchy.

Use this command (in the terminal) to fulfill pre-requisites 

"mkdir /home/project/chatapp-with-voice-and-openai/certs/

cp /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/rootCA.crt /home/project/chatapp-with-voice-and-openai/certs/"





Method 2: If you want to run it locally (you had to prove a point didn't you!!)
